## 🛠️ Our Mission

We believe in the power of native desktop applications. In a world moving entirely to the cloud, we craft tools that respect your privacy, work offline, and utilize the full power of your hardware.

Our workflow is built on professional CI/CD standards, ensuring that every release is stable, tested, and ready for production.

## 🚀 Flagship Project

### **[Glyph](https://github.com/berkacunas/Glyph)**
> *A modern, multi-tab Markdown editor built with Python & PySide6.*

Glyph is our proof of concept for modern desktop engineering. It combines the flexibility of web technologies (Chromium) with the performance of native code (Qt).

* ✅ **Live Preview:** Side-by-side rendering.
* ✅ **Professional:** PDF export, advanced syntax highlighting.
* ✅ **Open Source:** Licensed under GPLv3.
